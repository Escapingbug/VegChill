# VegChill - VegChicken's LLDB/GDB plugin
`VegChill` is a fully extensible `Xdb` plugin. By `Xdb` I mean lldb or gdb. It is first designed
to be an lldb plugin, but suddenly it seems to be working under gdb as well. With the concept of
`plugin's plugin` and `extension`, it can be easily extended by just `pip install` some related
plugin.

Currently `VegChill` is still in actively development status, many default features are
still missing, and not recommended to try out for now. Once everything's prepared to use,
we'll upload `VegChill` onto `pypi`, thus make it pip installable and show its muscle.
