# VegChill - VegChicken's LLDB plugin
`VegChill` is a fully extensible `lldb` plugin. With the concept of `plugin's plugin` and
`extension`, it can be easily extended by just `pip install` some related plugin.

Currently `VegChill` is still in actively development status, many default features are
still missing, and not recommended to try out for now. Once everything's prepared to use,
we'll upload `VegChill` onto `pypi`, thus make it pip installable and show its muscle.
